# Sample connecting WebApp and Azure SignalR Service

## Provision a SignalR Service

First let's provision a SignalR service on Azure.
> If you don't have an Azure subscription, **[start now](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/)** to create a free account.

1. Open Azure portal, click "Create a resource" and search "SignalR Service".


2. Navigate to "SignalR Service" and click "Create".
   

3. Fill in basic information including resource name, resource group and location.


   Resource name will also be used as the DNS name of your service endpoint. So you'll get a `<resource_name>.service.signalr.net` that your application can connect to.

   Select a pricing tier. There're two pricing tiers:
   
   * Free: which can handle 20 connections at the same time and can send and receive 20,000 messages in a day.
   * Standard: which has 1000 concurrent connections and one million messages per day limit for *one unit*. You can scale up to 100 units for a single service instance and you'll be charged by the number of units you use.

4. Click "Create", your SignalR service will be created in a few minutes.


After your service is ready, go to the **Keys** page of your service instance and you'll get two connection strings that your application can use to connect to the service.
